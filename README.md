Per instructions, here are my initial thoughts on the questions posed throughout
this Udacity course. Hopefully, my early efforts read as clear and concise. 
Should they not, I'm confident that clarity and understanding will improve over 
time. 


From Udacity:

Sharing your reflections
We encourage you to be bold in sharing your reflections on GitHub. If you're 
not happy with any of your responses, the best solution is to update that 
response in one or more new commits. The previous response will still be visible 
in the commit history, but updating your perspective over time is part of the 
learning process! Having a commit history that shows your updating perspective 
will reflect well on you, not poorly.

That said, if you've written anything in your reflections repository that you 
are not comfortable sharing, you can checkout the commit before you introduced 
that change, create a new branch at that point, and commit any other changes you 
are willing to share to the new branch. Then, by only pushing your new branch, 
you can keep the changes on your original branch private.
