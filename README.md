Effective use of version control is an important and useful skill for any 
developer working on long-lived (or even medium-lived) projects, especially 
if more than one developer is involved. This course, built with input from 
GitHub, will introduce the basics of using version control by focusing on a 
particular version control system called Git and a collaboration platform 
called GitHub.

Git is used by many tech companies, and a public GitHub profile serves as a 
great portfolio for any developer. But more than that, youâ€™ll establish an 
efficient programming workflow that allows you to:

1. Keep track of multiple versions of a file
2. Track bugs by reverting to previous working versions of a file
3. Seamlessly collaborate with other developers on a project
4. The use of tools like Git and GitHub is essential for collaborating with 
   other developers in most professional environments.
